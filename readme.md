# 8bs Resource Mods
Resource modifications for 8 beat Storyâ™ª to enhance QoL for playing on custom servers.


## Setup
1. Install Python 3.12+ and pycryptodome package (can be installed in venv)
2. Copy resource .zip files to `res` directory, e.g. `res/729/1_bg.zip`, ...
    - You can use Android or iOS resources. The only difference seems to be a few
      old/unused files leftover in the iOS version.
3. Copy `tutorial_2.zip` to `tutorial` directory.
4. Copy the game's Android .apk file (version 2.3.15) to the `apk` directory, rename
   it to `game.apk`.
5. Copy your `server-public-key.pem` and `server-private-key.pem` to `keys` directory
    - Also copy source's public key as `server-public-key-orig.pem` if you'd like to
      re-encrypt files from old key to new key.


## Usage
Open a terminal to this directory (the one containing `readme.md` and the scripts), then
refer to the information below for each script.

### disable\_iap.py
Usage: `python disable_iap.py <resource_path> <ver>`

Used to disable in-app purchases.
Useful because in-app purchases depend on app stores we don't control.

### gen\_delta\_update.py
Usage: `python gen_delta_update.py <resource_path> <ver_old> <ver_new>`

Used to generate an incremental ("delta") update containing the changes between two
versions.
Changes are written into `<ver_old + 1>.zip`, located in the new version's directory.

### make\_eternal\_exchange\_event.py
Usage: `python make_eternal_exchange_event.py <resource_path> <ver>`

Makes an exchange event (BIT festa) that lasts forever (until 2038).
All event cards are available as rewards and other item quantities have been increased.
This ensures players have access to event cards that aren't in gacha.

### new\_ver.py
Usage: `python new_ver.py <resource_path> <ver_old> <ver_new>`

Used to initialise a new version with no changes.
Copies the base (non-delta) .zip archives from ver_old to ver_new, and updates
`1_pkg/version.json` to reflect the new version number.

### recrypt\_zip.py
Usage: `python recrypt_zip.py <zip_path>`

Used to update JSON files to a new RSA encryption key.
Decrypts all encrypted files in a single .zip archive `server-public-key-orig.pem`,
and re-encrypts them using `server-private-key.pem`.
Useful for tutorial .zip files.

### recrypt\_ver.py
Usage: `python recrypt_ver.py <resource_path> <ver>`

Used to update JSON files to a new RSA encryption key.
Decrypts all encrypted files in specified version using `server-public-key-orig.pem`,
and re-encrypts them using `server-private-key.pem`.


## Getting Started for a Custom Server
Some early updates are highly recommended to be performed as follows.
You can apply them manually, or see below for an automated process.

### Tutorial
The tutorial must have files from the game client merged, then be re-encrypted with a key
we control.

1. Extract the `json` directory from the game's .apk file (inside `assets` dir),
   add it to `tutorial_2.zip`
    - Makes the game use newly-encrypted versions rather than its own bundled ones
2. `python recrypt_zip.py tutorial/tutorial_2.zip`

### 730
Version 730 is recommended to take original data from the final update (version 729) and
re-encrypt it with a key we control (no other changes).

1. `python new_ver.py res 729 730`
2. Copy `master_system` (both .json and .c) from the game's .apk file into
   `res/730/1_json01.zip`, and `master_music3001_1` into `res/730/1_json03.zip`
    - These two files aren't present in prior server resource .zips, so manually add them
3. `python recrypt_ver.py res 730`
4. `python gen_delta_update.py res 729 730`

### 731
Version 731 is recommended to disable in-app purchases, as they cannot be supported
without re-publishing the app in app stores.

1. `python new_ver.py res 730 731`
2. `python disable_iap.py res 731`
3. `python gen_delta_update.py res 730 731`

### 732
Version 732 is recommended to create an eternal exchange event (BIT festa), so players
can obtain event cards and rewards.

1. `python new_ver.py res 731 732`
2. `python make_eternal_exchange_event.py res 732`
3. `python gen_delta_update.py res 731 732`

### Automatically Creating Recommended Updates
You can use `create_recommended_updates.py` to automate the process of generating the
recommended updates.

1. `python create_recommended_updates.py`


## Developing New Updates
You can use `crypto.py` as a command line application to decrypt files for exploration.
In general, the .json files act like a relational database, but all data types and keys
are implied rather than defined by a schema. (In reality, they seem to be exported
from spreadsheet software.)

Python has very good support for JSON - you can refer to `disable_iap.py` or
`make_eternal_exchange_event.py` for some examples of processing existing JSON files.

Images should be .png, preferrably the same resolution as original files. If possible,
compress them to 8-bit indexed colour using pngquant (or a similar tool), to save space
and better match most official assets.
